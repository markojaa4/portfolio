# Law firm web site

Completed on 17th November 2017.

A website I worked on while working for the company Ipoint.

I was given an old design and my job was to build it from the ground up according to modern practices and the company standards, and also implement a WordPress back-end.

It is fully responsive, touch-screen friendly and tested thoroughly on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge and Internet Explorer down to IE8.
